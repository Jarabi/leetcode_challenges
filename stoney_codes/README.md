# Leetcode Problems

## Big O Summary

| Time Complexity (fastest to slowest)  | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| O(1) - Constant | Time taken remains constant regardless of input size. | Accessing an element in an array by index. |
| O(log N) - Logarithmic | Time taken increases logarithmically as the input size grows. Operations are typically halved at each step. Time increases linearly as N goes up exponentially. | Binary search in a sorted array. |
| O(N) - Linear | Time taken increases proportionally to the size of the input. If N doubles, time taken doubles. | Finding an item in an unsorted list. |
| O(N log N) - Linearithmic | Time taken increases in a linearithmic manner, often seen in `divide and conquer` algorithms. | Merge sort or quick sort |
| O(N^2) - Quadratic | Time taken increases quadratically as the input size grows. Each element needs to be compared to every other element (nested loops). | Bubble sort or selection sort. |
| O(2^N) - Exponential | Time taken doubles with each addition to N, leading to rapidly growing execution times. | Finding all subsets of a set. |
| O(N!) - Factorial | Time taken increases factorially with each increase in input size, leading to extremely slow execution times. | Solving the travelling salesman problem exhaustively. |
